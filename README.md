Overview:
A personalized ingredient safety app that analyzes skincare and makeup products based on your unique skin type and conditions. Inspired by Yuka, but reimagined to reflect individualized dermatological needs, not just general safety.

Problem:
Most ingredient-scanning apps give generalized scores — but everyone’s skin is different. What’s safe for oily skin might trigger eczema, and what helps acne might worsen dryness.

We built a system that:
Scores individual ingredients based on your specific skin profile (e.g., acne-prone, dry, sensitive)
Analyzes products using a weighted scoring model
Learns over time to improve recommendations through feedback
